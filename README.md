Assumptions Made
========
-- assumed longest speech means the number of lines that the speech consists of

-- the description said that PGROUPs have no relevance, but I grabbed the list of PERSONAs, inside of each PGROUP to add to the list of roles (not sure if not relevant meant to not grab those particular PERSONAs in each group or that the element itself was not relevant)

-- assuming the xml to json library I'm using works ok

-- assuming it was ok to convert the xml to json :)

-- assuming plays will never be too big such that the browser will not be able to calculate the stats itself

-- assumed it was ok to not use a an actual server sided component for this assignment

-- there wasn't anything about pagination or being able to see the whole list of elements so I didn't build that into it
